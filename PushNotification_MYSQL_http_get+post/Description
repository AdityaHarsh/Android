Plz note that the source code for push notification was taken from androidhive.com

The app is basically used so that the user who registers for the notifications will get updates from the admin via google cloud messaging.
Once registered the app will show the upcoming events and details about it. this is done by connecting it to MYSQL.
Also if the user wants to register for a particular event he can type from his device and it will be stored in a database
All notifications and etails are then pushed by the Admin from the web page to all the registered devices.
